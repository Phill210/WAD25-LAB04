### 🧾 **README.md**

```markdown
# NUST WAD621S – Lab 4: Registration → Profile Cards

## 👨‍💻 Student Information
**Name:** Mafwila Ilishebo  
**Student Number:** 223052604  
**Course:** Web Application Development (WAD621S)  
**Institution:** Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST)  
**Lab Duration:** 25 August – 2 September

---

## 🧠 **Lab Objective**
The goal of this lab was to design and implement an **accessible registration form** with **client-side validation** and dynamic DOM manipulation.  
The system allows users to:
- Register student information via a form.
- Dynamically generate a **profile card** for each student.
- Maintain a synchronized **summary table**.
- Support **remove actions** that update both the card and table.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5** – for structure and form semantics  
- **CSS3** – for layout, responsive styling, and accessibility  
- **JavaScript (DOM)** – for form validation, event handling, and dynamic rendering  

---

## ⚙️ **Features Implemented**
✅ Semantic and accessible registration form  
✅ Inline validation with error messages and aria-live feedback  
✅ Dynamic profile card creation  
✅ Summary table synchronized with form submissions  
✅ Remove functionality (updates both card and table)  
✅ Clean, commented, and readable code
